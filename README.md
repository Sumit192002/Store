# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Login Process
The login functionality of the app is implemented using the DummyJSON authentication API. Users input their credentials (username and password), and a POST request is made to the API's login endpoint. Upon successful authentication, a token is received in the response. The token is crucial for subsequent authorized requests.

From secure user authentication to dynamic product fetching, search functionality, and cart management, the app incorporates key elements for a successful E-Commerce platform. The use of modern frontend technologies and best practices ensures maintainability and scalability in the long run.
